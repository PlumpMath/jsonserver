Telemetry tests
===============

Essentially test competition server api calls on the actual `server.js` file.
Both the UAS python test server and our JSON server.js server must be running.

###Running these tests

To run any of the tests on this folder, type the line below...

```
node nameOfTheTestOnThisFolder.js
```

As you may have just found out, you do in fact need Node.js to run these tests. And the main server.js. And pretty much everything else in this repository. To install, read the actual README.md file supplied in the root directory of this repository.
